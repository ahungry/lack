# Lack

A Slack GUI built using the Yue (https://github.com/yue/yue)

# Purpose

To be a fast (non-bloated) Slack GUI.

# Note

This is *very* early/WIP, do not bother to use, just poking around the
framework for the most part.

Also - my C/C++ is a bit *LACK*ing (get it?  haha...how many puns can
we fit in here?).

# Building

At the moment the following libs will need to be installed (don't
worry, at some point their checks will be incorporated into the build
process and hopefully a real ./configure script/check).

- libwebsockets
- libcurl
